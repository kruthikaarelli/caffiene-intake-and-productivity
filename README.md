# Caffeine Intake and Study Hours Analysis
## Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between caffeine intake and study hours among students.
The analysis aims to determine whether moderate caffeine consumption is associated with increased study time compared to low or high intake levels. 
Our hypothesis is that students with moderate caffeine intake will show higher study hours due to the positive effects of caffeine on focus and alertness.

## Insights
The average study hours for students consuming moderate levels of caffeine (identified as level 3) were significantly higher compared to those with low or very high intake. This suggests that moderate caffeine intake fosters an optimal environment for effective studying.
The distribution of study hours within the moderate caffeine group displayed less variability and a higher median, reinforcing the idea that students who consume moderate amounts of caffeine tend to have more consistent and productive study sessions.
The analysis indicated a clear upward trend, confirming that the optimal caffeine level identified is 3. This suggests that this level maximizes study hours, aligning with the expectation that moderate intake enhances focus and alertness.
