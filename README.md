Caffeine Intake and Study Hours Analysis
Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between caffeine intake and study hours among students. The analysis aims to determine whether moderate caffeine consumption is associated with increased study time compared to low or high intake levels. Our hypothesis is that students with moderate caffeine intake will show higher study hours due to the positive effects of caffeine on focus and alertness.
